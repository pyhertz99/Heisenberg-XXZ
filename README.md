README for Heisenberg-XXZ repository

- all general-purpose functions are stored and annotated in the heisenberg-XXZ.py module
- other files are intended to either create, save or plot particular examples
- these files can save samples in the data/ folder (create it with subfolders domain-wall, neel and single-spin if not included) and analyse already saved samples
- for further info on this topic see the notes/spin-models.pdf file (czech)
